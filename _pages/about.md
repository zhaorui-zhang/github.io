I received my Ph.D.'s degree from the System Research Group at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am very fortunate to work with my supervisor Professor [Cho-Li Wang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~clwang/). Before joining HKU, I worked as a research assistant in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).


Research Interests:
======
My research mainly focuses on machine learning systems, especially for distributed machine/deep learning systems, which is an interdisciplinary research area relevant to distributed systems, distributed optimization, stochastic optimization, and machine learning/deep learning, that aims to optimize the distributed deep learning system from both sides of system and machine/deep learning algorithms, like distributed communication reduction, gradient error constraints, and deep learning compilation optimization, etc.

I am also interested in high-performance computing (HPC), distributed systems, cloud computing, and FPGA.
