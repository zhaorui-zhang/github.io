Bio:
======
I received my Ph.D.'s degree from the System Research Group at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am very fortunate to work with my supervisor Professor [Cho-Li Wang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~clwang/). Before joining HKU, I worked as a research assistant in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong Universit](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

Research Interests:
======
My research mainly focuses on distributed machine/deep learning systems (machine learning systems), which is an interdisciplinary research area relevant to distributed systems, distributed optimization, stochastic optimization, and machine learning/deep learning, and aims to optimize the distributed deep learning system from both sides of system and machine/deep learning algorithms. 

I am also interested in distributed systems, high-performance computing, cloud computing, and FPGA.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
