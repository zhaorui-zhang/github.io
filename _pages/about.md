I am currently a research assistant professor at [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I am also a member of [Internet and Mobile Computing Laboratory (IMCL)](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html)


Research Interests:
======
I am broadly interested in the building and optimization of AI systems (MLSys) from both sides of the system and machine learning algorithms based on a wide range of computing platforms (e.g., distributed, cloud, HPC, IoT, AIoT, and even quantum and photonic platforms) for emerging big data and AI applications, including distributed communication reduction, gradient error constraints, and deep learning compilation optimization, etc.

I am also interested in high-performance computing (HPC), distributed systems, cloud computing, and FPGA.

<!-- which is an interdisciplinary research area relevant to distributed systems, distributed optimization, stochastic optimization, and machine learning/deep learning, that aims to optimize the distributed deep learning system from both sides of system and machine/deep learning algorithms, like distributed communication reduction, gradient error constraints, and deep learning compilation optimization, etc. -->

Opening: 
======
Currently, We are looking for student interns who would like to work with us in the area of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys). Students who want to spend several months in HK for your Final Year Project (“毕业设计”) are also welcome to reach out with your CV.
